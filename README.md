# Otosaka---Spaced-Repetition-System
This application is a web-based Spaced Repetition System (SRS) designed to optimize learning efficiency. Unlike standard flashcard apps, it separates "Data" (Notes) from "Scheduling" (Cards), allowing for complex knowledge structures like Cloze Deletions, Reverse Cards, and Image Occlusion to be managed dynamically.
